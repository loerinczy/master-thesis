Master thesis at JKU


This is my master thesis at the Johannes Kepler University Artificial Intelligence Master study.
It is still under development, the finish is expected to be around end of May, mid June.

As for now, it is constituted of 2 parts:
  * implementation of the baselines: ReLayNet and DeepRetina
  * implementation of the novel approach coined RetLSTM (name may change over time)

This will be further extended by uncertainty estimation.
